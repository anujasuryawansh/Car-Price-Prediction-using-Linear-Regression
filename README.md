# Car Price Prediction

This project demonstrates how to predict car prices using Linear Regression and Lasso Regression. It uses historical data to train the models and evaluate their performance.


## Introduction

Car prices are influenced by various factors including age, mileage, brand, and other features. This project aims to predict car prices based on these features using two regression techniques: Linear Regression and Lasso Regression.

## Data Description

The dataset `car_prices.csv` includes the following columns:

- Car_Name`: Name of the car
- `Year`: Year of manufacture
- `Selling_Price`: Price at which the car is sold
- `Present_Price`: Current market price of the car
- `Kms_Driven`: Total kilometers driven
- `Fuel_Type`: Type of fuel (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, CNG)
- `Seller_Type`: Type of seller (e.g., Individual, Dealer)
- `Transmission`: Type of transmission (e.g., Manual, Automatic)
- `Owner`: Number of previous owners
